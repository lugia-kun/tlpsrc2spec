# tlpsrc2spec

*WARNING*: This is for RPM packager's use. 

*WARNING*: The name of package says that it generates ".spec" file from ".tlpsrc" files. But, currently, loading ".tlpsrc" files is not supported (because ".tlpsrc" files lack major information of the package (summary, description, etc.). Use complete ".tlpdb" file instead.

Creates RPM Spec file (except for %prep, %build and %install sections) from ~~tlpsrc~~ tlpdb files.

Currently, this program is only for [Momonga Linux](http://www.momonga-linux.org/). If you want to use this framework for your distribution, it is already ready to do this. Please open an issue to request this.
